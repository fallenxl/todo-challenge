# ToDoToday (Challenge)

ToDoToday is a todo list project developed frontend side with `react + vite`
and server side with `nodejs (Express.js)`

[ðŸ”—ToDoToday]: https://todo-challenge-production.up.railway.app/

### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Start a local server to preview the site

```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` to see the site locally. Changes to assets will
rebuild the site. Refresh to see your changes.

To do a production build of the site and start the local server
run `yarn build && git push`.

## Deploying the site ðŸš€

The site is deployed on `railway`, for which we use their database services.
